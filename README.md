# SmallCal Day Planner

This application is a leightweight day planner that will allow the user to save items in the schedule on a daily basis and clear them out for the next day. You can find the application [here](https://andrearene.github.io/Day_Planner/) I designed it to meet the following criteria:

* A single work day planner that displays the current date and blocks for text input for the hours 9 am to 5 pm
* A planner that indicates at a glance the current, past, and future hours by way of a color change
* A planner that will save user entered data when they click on a save or save all button that will persist through refreshing or closing. 
* A way for the user to clear the entire schedule at once if desired.
* A simple, no frills design targeted at mobile users who may not be particularly tech savvy. 
* An interface that is intuitive for users 
* An application that is easily scaleable and expandable
* A simple and clean interface with a responsive design that accomodates screen sizes ranging from 320px to 1920px
